### What is LearnSpace ? 

LearnSpace™ is an application that is aimed at helping the students and teachers with online learning during the pandemic era. With the COVID pandemic showing no sight of slowing down, it becomes imperative to search for permanent solutions for online based classroom learning. 

Within LearnSpace™, teachers will be able to create a 'course' within their own personal classroom. Within this course, the teacher will be able to share study material, post assignments, collect and grade responses, post the quizzes which will deliver students responses by 'autograding' them and share important messages with the students. 

Similarly, students will be able to join courses, view and download study material and assignments, upload their own submissions for the assignments, attempt quizzes and chat with the rest of the class. 

LearnSpace™ creates beautiful downloadable assessment reports for the assignments and quizzes thus making it easier for the teacher to analyse, collect and visualise the class performance. 

The application is now available in both light as well as dark mode with increased features and functionalities. Follow the link http://dbms-front.herokuapp.com/registerlogin to explore more !
